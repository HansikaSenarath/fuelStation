					China which remains mute at a time when Sri Lanka desperately needs support, encouragement and humanitarian assistance, has decided to dispatch a warship instead of extending a hand of support and help to the crisis-hit Sri Lanka.

                    Today, Sri Lanka is facing its worse economic crisis since gaining Independece from the British and is struggling to provide essentials including food, fuel, domestic gas and medicinal requirements to the people. As the country looks up to neighboring and world nations for help, China which is one of the main creditors of Sri Lanka, has been unresponsive.

                    After keeping mum for several months, China has selected Sri Lanka’s Southern Port at Hambantota as one of the stops for its ‘Research’ vessel Yuan Wang 5. Since July, the vessel has been on course from China to the Hambantota Port after Sri Lankan officials approved a stop there for “replenishment.” It was scheduled to dock at August 11. However, after Indian and US officials strongly raised concerns about the visit by the Chinese vessel, the Sri Lankan Government revoked access given to the vessel to visit the port.

                    Media reported that the Vessel had now reduced speed and turned around, only to make another U-turn at sea and continue toward the island.

                    Following Sri Lanka’s decision to revoke access, China indirectly accused India of “gross interference” in its affairs and dismissed its complaints that sensors onboard the Yuan Wang 5 could be used to peer inside India.

                    “It is unreasonable for a third party to put pressure on Sri Lanka on the grounds of so-called security concerns,” Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing.

                    In response, the Indian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman said, “India rejects insinuation by China over its vessel not being able to dock at Hambantota”.

                    Meanwhile, Most Ven Dr. Waskaduwe Mahindawansa Mahanayake Thera, the Mahanayake Thera of Sri Sambuddha Sasanodaya Sangha Sabha of Sri Lanka Amarapura Great Assembly in a statement said China wants to take advantage of the very weak and desperate situation of Sri Lanka to take steps towards achieving its geo-strategic objectives.<br>
