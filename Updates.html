                        Politically and financially affected-Sri Lanka is running out of options in importing discounted fuel directly from Russia following the refusal of the two of its companies sanctioned by the Russian Ambassador Yury Materiy to enter into procurement agreements with local authorities this week.

                        The Energy Ministry had taken every possible step to convince the two representatives of Russian companies who visited the country last month to enter these petroleum procurement deals on favourable terms and conditions, a senior ministry official revealed.

                        However these two Russian companies have conveyed their inability to supply oil on long term credit as well as the financial transaction issues of banks owing to Sri Lanka’s declaration of foreign debt default, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) sources said.</li> </ul>

                        According to reports, Sinopec is set to join the Sri Lankan market for the purpose of importing, distributing, and selling petroleum products, according to the Daily Mirror. This comes after Sri Lankan Cabinet Ministers accepted a plan in June to enable additional corporations from oil-producing countries to import oil and begin retail operations in Sri Lanka.

                        Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister of Power and Energy, presented the suggestion.

                        It is important to remember that the biggest economic crisis in Sri Lanka’s history has resulted in a severe scarcity of vital products such as fuel. Long lines at petrol stations are the new normal in Sri Lanka, and prices vary according to supply.</li> </ul>
